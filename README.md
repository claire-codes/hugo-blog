## What are all those emojis in your commits?

A random emoji is prefixed to every commit message I write as a pre-commit hook. The hook is installed by this amazing Ruby gem [emoji-commit](https://github.com/claireparker/emoji-commit) (that I wrote ðŸ˜Š). The emoji choice is random but often weirdly suited to the contents of the commit message ... ðŸ‘½ðŸ”®

## Developing

Install hugo with `brew install hugo`. Install node packages with `npm i`.

Run `hugo server` locally and go to `http://localhost:1313/`. Push changes and Netlify takes care of the rest.

## Sass

Using Hugo pipes (see code in head.html partial) means we don't need to install JavaScript packages to compile Sass. However, as of version 0.54.0 and with deploying on Netlify, I still need to commit the `resources/` folder with all the compiled stuff in it.

## Theme

I use the [Ted](https://github.com/claireparker/hugo-ted) theme. I built the theme from scratch instead of overwriting an existing one. It's not in a state where it can be used yet because I need to move certain files out of the main blog and into the theme, but it's on the To-Do list.

The name comes from my beautiful ~~son~~ dog, Ted.

## Archetypes

Two templates for front matter (a.k.a. archetypes) exist: `blog` and `dev-diary`. To use them, create a new file like: `hugo new dev-diary/2018-10-02.md` or `hugo new blog/post.md`.

Ensure the file suffix matches the one used in the archetype, i.e. my archetypes are `.md` files, so if I did `hugo new blog/post.markdown` the archetype wouldn't be used.

## Dev Diary

I post this once a week. To generate a new one, type `hugo new dev-diary/2019-02-05-dev-diary.markdown` at the command line, replacing the date in the title. The YAML should be `title`, `date` and `interests` (this field name is a hangover from when the page used to be called "Interesting" and it still sounds best to me). `interests` is a list (bullets are hyphens). Content of the post is posted at the top, followed by the `interests` list.

## SEO page title and descriptions.

Each page should have unique meta description tag content, i.e. `<meta name="description" content="foobar">`, for SEO and appearing in search results. Additionally, each page has a `<title>` tag which sets the title at the top of each tab in the browser. Since this is a small site, I've set this specifically on each page rather than putting it in the generic `head.html` template. Although the format is generally the same for each page, this allows you to customise it easily per page: if you want to hardcode a description or title, go ahead. If you want to use the site title, or the generic site description, you can do (`Site.Title` and `Site.Params.Description`). Since not every page has an associated content template either, the method of checking for parameters won't be the same. This method gives the most flexibility.
