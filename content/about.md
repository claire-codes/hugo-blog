I love reading other people's bios but hate writing my own. Here is a picture and a list:

* I'm a frontend web developer
* I work in sunny Manchester ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
* I love CSS, JavaScript, writing tests and typing things really really fast on the command line like a proper hacker
* I am the "person who likes emoji" in the office
* I have a beautiful dog son who I love talking about and showing photos of
* I think lists are pretty cool too

This is my corner of the internet where I write about tech stuff I've learnt so I can remember how I did it later, because I have a memory like a sieve.
