Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Claire Parker-Jones, a UX Designer. I've been a (mostly frontend) developer for eight years, and have recently transitioned into the product design area of web development. This blog is my place to learn in public.

I've been publishing blog posts about web development on this site since 2015. Some of my most popular posts are:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/blog/2021-03-24-one-sided-borders-in-figma/">One Sided Borders in Figma</a></li>
  <li><a href="/blog/2019-04-26-styling-list-bullets-with-emoji">Styling list bullets with emoji</a></li>
  <li><a href="/blog/2021-02-01-font-face-and-styled-components/">Font-face and Styled Components</a></li>
</ul>

I post more tech lifestyle content on <a href="https://instagram.com/claire_codes">my Instagram account claire_codes</a>, underneath photos of my laptop and my dog.
