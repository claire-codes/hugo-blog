I love reading other people's bios but hate writing my own. Here is a picture and a list:

* I'm a frontend web developer
* I work in sunny Manchester ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
* I love CSS and JavaScript
* I also love dogs and emoji

This is my corner of the internet where I write about stuff I've learnt so I can come back to it later. I know no one reads my blog and you probably think it's a bit sad but I find it fun and it keeps me busy in the evenings and doing dangerous things like PHP or Java.
