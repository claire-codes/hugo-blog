Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Claire Parker-Jones, a frontend/front end/front-end web developer. I like **writing about code** just as much as I like **writing code**.

I've been publishing blog posts on this site since 2015. I write about JavaScript, CSS, HTML, code editors, the command line, emoji and all sorts of other web development related topics.

I post even more coding content on <a href="https://instagram.com/claire_codes">my Instagram account claire_codes</a>, underneath photos of my laptop and my dog. (Yep, Instagram has a coding community. It's much more civilised than tech Twitter ðŸ™ƒ)

You can <a href="https://instagram.com/claire_codes">follow me on Instagram</a>, <a href="/index.xml" type="application/rss+xml" target="\_blank">subscribe to the RSS feed of this site</a> or <a href="mailto:claire@clairecodes.com?subject=Hi%20clairecodes">send me an email</a> to say hi ðŸ˜Š
