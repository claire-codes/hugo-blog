Hello there, I'm Claire, a frontend/front end/front-end web develope. I like writing about code just as much as I like writing code.

I've been publishing blog posts on this site since 2015. I write about JavaScript, CSS, HTML, code editors, the command line, emoji and all sorts of other web development related topics.

You can find even more of my thoughts on coding at <a href="https://instagram.com/claire_codes">my Instagram account claire_codes</a>, sitting underneath photos of my laptop and my dog. (Yes, Instagram has coding community. It's much more civilised than tech Twitter.)

You can <a href="https://instagram.com/claire_codes">follow me on Instagram</a>, <a href="/index.xml" type="application/rss+xml" target="\_blank">subscribe to the RSS feed of this site</a> or <a href="mailto:claire@clairecodes.com?subject=Hi%20clairecodes">send me an email</a> to say hi ðŸ˜Š
