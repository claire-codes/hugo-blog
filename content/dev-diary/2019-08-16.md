  - Published a short blog musing about [committing to a blogging goal "seasonally"](/blog/2019-08-16-blogging-seasonally/)
  - Came across another personal site where the author was doing something similar to my Dev Diary for the first time ever! They called it "Weeknotes" (I forgot to note the url).
  - "[Posted on Instagram about overusing exclamation marks in my writing](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1MUZ9bAH15/) - definitely something I need to keep an eye on as I think it's the written equivalent of meek and submissive body language."
  - "(Bringing A Healthy Code Review Mindset To Your Team)[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/bringing-healthy-code-review-mindset] - there are so many good points in this article, particularly the one saying that code reviews should take a long time and you should check branches out on your own machine to thoroughly test them."

After I was made redundant last week by my full-time employment (although I'm on maternity for the forseeable future), I updated my LinkedIn to reflect my next ideal role: part-time, remote frontend web development. Although most recruiters and hiring mangers would laugh in my face, I'm sure such a thing exists. I want to get ahead of the game and keep an eye on the job market now.
