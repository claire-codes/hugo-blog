So Blogtober didn't go that well! I managed a grand total of one published post and one draft. What have we learnt from this? That I'm not motivated enough to post regularly right now. I have plenty of ideas, but am not disciplined enough to write them up. Even trying to embarass myself into posting more hasn't worked! Oh well. Next job on the list, a redesign of this Dev Diary page and format.
