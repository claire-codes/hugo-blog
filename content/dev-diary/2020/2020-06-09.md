- "I wrote a [Family Fortunes style app](https://github.com/claire-codes/family-fortunes) for my family quiz night (or Family Feud if you're in the US). I used the Vue CLI which is the Vue equivalent to create-react-app. I found it really easy and pleasant to use, and the Family Fortunes round of my quiz was a success!"

Lockdown measures are easing a lot in the UK, but most people I know working in tech will be working remotely for the time being with no signs of returning to an office. This is a good thing, because we've been trying to convince management of the benefits and productivity of remote work for a long time. However, I'm not sure how many people would be happy with working remotely permanently.
