- "[CSS Transitions for Multiple Properties on One Element](https://www.clairecodes.com/blog/2020-05-26-multiple-css-transitions/) - I published something at last! A 2 minute read on something I stumbled with in CSS a few weeks ago."
- "[Modern CSS Solutions](https://moderncss.dev/) - I love this series by Stephanie Eckles and especially the post [Totally Custom List Styles](https://moderncss.dev/totally-custom-list-styles/) which offers an alternative to [my emoji bullet point solution](https://www.clairecodes.com/blog/2019-04-26-styling-list-bullets-with-emoji/)."
- "I redesigned the footer on this site. I had a long row of text-less icons for each of my social profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter). I changed them to a grid layout with some hopefully more helpful text next to them. Perhaps I have too many links I want to share, but with this design I hope it's clearer what site visitors could do if they click on them."

I've stopped counting how many weeks ago lockdown started now! It's the new normal.

I published a blog post this week! Only two minutes before writing this week's Dev Diary mind you, but the main thing is I've completed a piece of writing and should be able to publish more consistently now I've broke my dry spell. Join me next week and I might have completed another of my half-finished posts!
