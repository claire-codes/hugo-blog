Where have I been? Preparing for a child's 1st birthday party! It consumed my life for a couple of weeks: decorations, food and a Sesame Street themed cake smash, all for a little person who won't remember any of it! But this was my way of subconsciously distracting myself from the thing that started a few days later: a [new job!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claireparkerjones/) Part-time hours, fully remote (for the time being) and exactly the area I want to focus on: UI development. It's finally worked out well after all these months of uncertainty (I got laid off nearly a year ago at the beginning of my maternity leave). In the meantime, a new routine, a new project, a new team and a new operating system (Windows instead of Mac ðŸ˜±) to get used to.
