- "Not much - enjoying a two week break from work. Not being able to change my scenery has meant that changing my daily routine and the things I need to think about has been important in order to give my brain a rest and chance to recharge. Therefore I've been reading novels instead of dev blogs, and creating physical photo albums instead of blog posts."

Last Dev Diary of the year and time to reflect. I normally do a year in review blog post covering how I've found the year development-wise, which I'll write for 2020. I've enjoyed writing Dev Diary entries this year and found they were a pleasant weekly distraction during the strict three month lockdown we had over spring. I've tinkered with the format of them lately to improve how useful they are, and hope to continue writing them more regularly next year. 2021 goal is Consistent Content Creation.
