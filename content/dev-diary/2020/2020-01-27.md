I need to start making more of my time in the evening once the baby is in bed. This isn't me pushing myself too hard, or not taking time to rest - I just really need to peel myself off the sofa in the evening and apply for a job or write a blog post or create a CodePen demo. My big productivity hack has been to sit at the kitchen table instead of the sofa and I've found that this eventually makes me stop watching YouTube and start doing something a little less mindless!
