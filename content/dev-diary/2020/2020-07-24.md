- "[HTMHell special: close buttons](https://www.htmhell.dev/20-close-buttons/) - This is another topic that should be on a Frontend Dev 101 course, it shouldn't be that hard!"
- "[Background Patterns, Simplified by Conic Gradients](https://css-tricks.com/background-patterns-simplified-by-conic-gradients/) - I love seeing older frontend techniques updated with new technology, especially CSS patterns like this."
- "[Pixels vs. Relative Units in CSS: why itâ€™s still a big deal](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/pixels-vs-relative-units-in-css-why-its-still-a-big-deal/) - A good resource, and something I'll revisit as I tend to unquestioningly use pixels everywhere."

Now I'm working fully remote, I've set up a workspace in my spare bedroom and with a standing desk. So far I can manage about 45 minutes standing up before my joints complain and I need to sit down. I've read that you should expect to do a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio of sitting to standing - the intention isn't to stand up all day. It definitely feels better having the option to stand than only sitting all day, mind you.
