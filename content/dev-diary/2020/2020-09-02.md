This is the first time I've published anything all summer! Blame starting a job and finally being able to get out and about, now lockdown restrictions eased in the UK. No Instagram captions, blogs or Dev Diary posts since July, which must be a record for me. All I've done is push a small change to the blog, which ended up breaking my url structure and decreasing my traffic, but that's a story for another time and I think I've fixed it now ðŸ¤ž
