I wrote an introductory [Blogtober 2020](/blog/2020-10-01-blogtober-2020) post 19 days ago and haven't posted a thing since ðŸ˜… I was really hoping that by posting my intentions it would motivate me to write more, but it hasn't! Also, you know that period when it feels like everyone is sick in your family one after the other? We've had that in my house and I'm just enjoying everyone being healthy right now! Oh and I'm spending a lot of my evenings playing Super Mario Odyssey on my Switch (3 years late I know). Blame Mario for no content.
