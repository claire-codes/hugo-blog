date: 2020-11-25T08:45:00Z
reading:
- "[The world needs a tech diet; here is how designers can help](https://essays.uxdesign.cc/tech-diet/) - I loved the design of this page as much as the message. We can avoid building dark patterns into our web apps."
- "[How to de-Google your site to make it faster and visitor friendly](https://markosaric.com/degoogleify/) - A really useful overview of alternatives to Google-owned products in your website. Replacing Google Analytics is something I'd consider."
doing:
- "Making this Dev Diary page a little clearer to read by adding headings to this list section. I got to tinker with Hugo template design."
- "Getting used to [AutoLayout 3.0](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040451373-Create-dynamic-designs-with-Auto-Layout) in the latest Figma update. It mirrors flexbox principles more than the previous version, which makes life easier for me."
watching:
- "[Config Europe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7kSHHiltBqo3FK__aB5HZi) - The full playlist for Figma's virtual Config Europe conference. A nice background and relevant to me to hear how other people create design systems, now that this is a big part of my job."

I've been at my [current paid job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claireparkerjones/) for five months now and it's a big change of direction from my previous roles. I concentrate more on the design and UX side of frontend rather than the guts of React and Redux. I'm having a great time delving into this side of web devlopment and learn so much day-to-day. Consequently I find myself more mentally tired than when I was "only" writing CSS and JavaScript. Maybe I'd grown too comfortable with web development - or maybe it has something to do with the 1 year old that keeps me up half the night ðŸ˜…
