How do you get better at something? Through practise. I've realised that I read a lot about web development but don't spend that much time building websites. I read widely about the latest web trends, but using the tech that I read about is more valuable (if I can find the time of course!). So, more CodePen demos, short blog posts and create-react-app tests are the order of the day.
