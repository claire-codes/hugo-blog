My [coding Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/claire_codes/) has been dormant since July. It seems a shame since I spent so much time on it over the past couple of years. I got a bit fed up of taking photos though, which is pivotal to a photo-sharing platform! Plus I didn't like the focus on stories and videos - I just like writing lengthy captions no one reads. Blogging like this suits me more, plus gives me ownership of the content. It always feels a little weird to create content on someone else's platform and not have easy access to it. On the other hand, it was a friendly place to connect with people digitally, which I miss, so I might upload a new photo of my laptop soon.
