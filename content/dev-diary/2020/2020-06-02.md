- "I added `scroll-behavior: smooth` to [this site](https://github.com/claire-codes/hugo-blog/commit/d5a7029db698d42ce6eef9f4ec828e913aa60564) for a nicer scrolling animation and also added a media query for those that prefer reduced motion."
- "[Stop setting the language of your website based on user location](https://dev.to/bitdweller/stop-setting-the-language-of-your-website-based-on-my-location-31h0) - I agree with this post, instead use the browser's or system's language."
- "[When (not) to use the `<br>` element](https://webplatform.news/issues/2020-04-29#when-not-to-use-the-br-element) - Only use `<br>` for separating text in things like poems or addresses, and not as an impromptu paragraph."

In these difficult times, be mindful of your media and news consumption and limit how often you read the headlines. Take a break if it's getting overwhelming! Stay informed, but also stay healthy.
