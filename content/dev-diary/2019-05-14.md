  - "To practise Gatsby I started [a blog about Magento 1](https://claireparker.github.io/magento-1-frontend-bits/) last year. I don't have any new posts to write now I don't work with Magento but I upgraded it this week from Gatsby v1 to v2, which took longer than I anticipated."
  - "[10 questions you should ask  in a web dev interview](https://dev.to/flippedcoding/10-questions-you-should-ask-in-a-web-dev-interview-1c2d) - these are really important: I personally never ask enough about how projects are managed in an interview and it's a pivotal part of your day-to-day role."
  - "Do you want [Beyonce styled colour-themes](https://github.com/minamarkham/yonce) for your code editor? Mina Markham has an entire repo for different programs!"
  - "[In defense of the ternary statement](https://css-tricks.com/in-defense-of-the-ternary-statement/) - there is a lot of fear around ternaries but I agree with this post that they aren't that scary."

Today is my last day of work before my maternity leave starts!! I also have a [three week GitHub streak](https://github.com/claireparker?tab=overview&from=2019-04-23&to=2019-05-14) going on which will be interesting to see how long I can maintain.
