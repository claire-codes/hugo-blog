  - "I started a new side-project with VueJS and love it! It is _so_ easy to get started with compared to React. I've found an Egghead course to go over the basics more thoroughly which I'll try this week too."
  - "I've never needed to copy anything to the clipboard before using JavaScript, but finally found an excuse with my side-project. I've always wanted to try [clipboardJS](https://clipboardjs.com/) which is nice wrapper around the DOM methods and found it very simple to implement."

I've been on maternity leave for a week now and have been very busy so far - even though I'm not in work there's plenty of chores and jobs to be done, especially with baby prep! I've maintained my GitHub streak with a new project (although on a repo I haven't made public yet) but haven't found time to work on blog posts or catch up on links/email newsletters. I'm expecting to develop more of a routine over the next week.
