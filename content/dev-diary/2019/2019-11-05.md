It's time to seriously look for a new job. I was made redundant back in August just a couple of months into maternity leave, when Laterooms.com went into administration. I'd like to go back to work in the New Year, because I've taken all the baby classes I can stand! I want to work part-time, which isn't common, so I'm going to have to so some self-promotion and reach out to employers. All the recruiters I've messaged on LinkedIn go mysteriously quiet when I mention the word "part-time". Have I ever told you I hate dealing with recruiters?
