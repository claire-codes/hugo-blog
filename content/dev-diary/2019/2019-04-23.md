- "I posted [a blog about the universal selector in CSS](/blog/2019-04-21-my-misconceptions-about-the-universal-selector/) `*` and got a good reaction from the dev.to community when I [cross-posted it](https://dev.to/claireparker/my-misconceptions-about-the-universal-selector-in-css-4ngm). It got tweeted out on their main account (üèÜ internet points!) and I earned a badge for my account for posting an article for four weeks in a row! (I posted it at 23:50 on Sunday night too! ü§≠) It was especially satisfying because it took me ages to write: I knew roughly what I wanted to say but couldn't get it to read well, and it took more time to research than I thought)."
- "I wrote up an issue I was having with Liquid tags in `pre` blocks in a [blog post](/blog/2019-04-17-liquid-tag-page-build-failure-debug/). It was very specific to my GitHub Pages/deployment setup  so I didn't cross-post it anywhere but it might help someone!"
- "[Building a dependency free site by Michelle Barker](https://css-irl.info/building-a-dependency-free-site/) - an interesting experiment, but I really liked how Michelle admitted that she wouldn't stop using Sass for a while yet: I see more and more more devs denouncing Sass lately."
- "[How to avoid the boolean trap when designing React components](https://spicefactory.co/blog/2019/03/26/how-to-avoid-the-boolean-trap-when-designing-react-components/) - gave me food for thought about Booleans and how they can be overused and indicate additional complexity in your components."
- "[Finally a CSS only solution to hover on touchscreens](https://blog.usejournal.com/finally-a-css-only-solution-to-hover-on-touchscreens-c498af39c31c) - this has been an issue for a long time! Nice to see progress being made."

I was away on holiday this week, but that never stops me taking my laptop wherever I'm travelling to and doing a bit of light reading.
