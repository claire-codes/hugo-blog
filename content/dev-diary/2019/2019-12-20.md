- "[What Does a Coder Do If They Can't Type?](http://nsaphra.github.io/post/hands/) - I didn't know what the possibilities were if you couldn't use your hands to type, so this post was fascinating and enlightening."
- "[Optional Chaining in JavaScript](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/optional-chaining-helps-to-avoid-undefined-is-not-a-function-exceptions/) - this is a cool language additional that isn't well supported yet ([MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)) but would save a lot of keystroke."
- "I set up an EC2 instance with AWS using a CloudFormation script to host a Wordpress website (with the help of my AWS expert husband). Quick and impressive, although the UI was busy and overwhelming for newbie."

It's close to Christmas and so most job-hunting activities have stopped for the holidays. With a new baby, it's been more festive for me this year than for the past decade combined and I'm not worrying about securing a role by a certain date, just doing stuff when I find the time. Merry Christmas!
