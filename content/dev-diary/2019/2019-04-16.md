- "I wrote a new blog post about how to selectively ignore Prettier across your project. I posted it [on this blog](/blog/2019-04-09-ignoring-prettier/) and [cross-posted on dev.to](https://dev.to/claireparker/ignoring-prettier-3pd1) as well - it was [tweeted out by their main account](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/1117835476004745216) and I earned all the Internet Points üèÜ"
