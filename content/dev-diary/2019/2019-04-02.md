  - "I published a [new blog post](/blog/2019-03-28-why-my-hugo-archetypes-didnt-work) this week, all about a problem I was having making archetypes work in this blog (spoiler: it was to do with the file extension of my markdown file)"
  - "I've been looking at tree-shaking with lodash in work and came across [this blog](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2019/03/07/lessons-on-tree-shaking-lodash/). The blog itself was good but I really liked the warning at the top of the article that reminds you that best practices change regularly - a nice touch from the author."
  - "[Why can't I set the font size of a visited link](https://jameshfisher.com/2019/03/08/why-cant-i-set-the-font-size-of-a-visited-link/) - because of security! Really interesting post that explains why you can't do certain styles using the ':visited' pseudo selector."
  - "[Improving the keyboard accessibility of CodePen embeds](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/improving-the-keyboard-accessibility-of-codepen-embeds/) - the author suggested some changes that you can make in your own site to improve a11y which was a different way of looking at the problem to me, i.e. assuming someone else will fix it."
