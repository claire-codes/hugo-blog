This week I've done [dev.to](https://dev.to/clairecodes) and [GitHub](https://github.com/claire-codes) - I have a feeling I'll find incorrect GitHub references for a long time to come!"
  - "I [posted to Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0yNI-sAHnd/) for the first time since I had my son and gave a life update to all my internet pals."

Laterooms.com went into administration last week and I, alongside all my colleagues, was made redundant. This doesn't affect me too much since I'm on maternity leave but it was still a shock and not what I wanted to hear when my baby had just turned one month old! I'll write a blog post or Instagram caption about this another time but this was definitely my biggest "dev" news this week.
