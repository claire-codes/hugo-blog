  - "I was feeling daft about thinking about work/coding while on maternity leave, until I learnt that in the USA women generally only get 6 weeks maternity leave (compared to 1 year in the UK!). Thanks to the comments on my [maternity leave Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/By25Ly4gvzZ/)."
  - "[Wrapping long words with CSS or HTML](https://www.cjcid.com/articles/wrapping-long-words-css-html/) - I'd never come across the `<wbr>` tag or the `&shy;` soft hyphen entity before."
  - "[Building the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect Lighthouse score](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/) - a really interesting experiment, and again shows that an automated score doesn't mean that your website it usable or accessible."

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, it's been a while! My son Ezra was born on the 1st July and everything since then has been a wonderful tired blur. The sleep deprivation is very real ðŸ˜´. As you can imagine, I haven't looked at anything tech-related for a while: no Twitter, no Instagram, no GitHub. However, sometimes it's nice to think about something other than nappies, so I'm reading a few tech blog posts here and there.
