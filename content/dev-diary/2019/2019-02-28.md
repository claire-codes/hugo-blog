I was away on holiday last week and didn't read or write a line of code. I also spent hardly any time on Instagram or Twitter. It was a very relaxing week! ðŸŒž What was important for me about this holiday was that I didn't mentally beat myself up because I wasn't spending my free time redesigning my blog, or taking photos for Instagram, or learning a new language etc. I made a choice to switch off and didn't worry about the million other ways I could have been "productively" spending my time. Sometimes it's most productive for your well-being to not do anything at all.
