- 'I attended another conference: [Halfstack](https://halfstackconf.com/) in London and had a great time. The gist of the conference for me was: you can do anything you like with JavaScript 👯‍♀️'
- "I started a side-project to collect CSS patterns (much like [Lea Verou’s pattern gallery](https://leaverou.github.io/css3patterns/)) and used React Router. (Still a work in progress.)"
- '[This blog post about the em tag](https://logrocket.com/blog/youre-using-em-wrong) was interesting - I enjoy learning about the correct use of semantic HTML tags.'
- '[This post](https://stackify.com/pair-programming-styles/) was a thorough introduction to pair programming and the different styles.'
