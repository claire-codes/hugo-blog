- "[doggo ipsum](https://doggoipsum.com/) - definitely bookmarking this for the next time I need placeholder text"
- "It's probably because I know I want to do Blogtober, but I haven't been motivated to blog recently. Instagram has also taken a back seat. Which is all fine because it's normal to have peaks and troughs in motivation for hobbies"
- "[The CSS background-image property as an anti-pattern](https://nystudio107.com/blog/the-css-background-image-property-as-an-anti-pattern) - I bookmarked this a while ago and since I don't post Dev Diary entries very regularly at the moment, I can't remember why! Still a good lesson though."

I'm challenging myself to Blogtober again this year, where I post a blog post for every day in October. I've been planning out subjects for posts, because thinking of 31 ideas for blog posts is the hardest bit! I maintain a privat Trello board for any blog ideas, whether it's Blogtober or not.
