  - I kept up my GitHub streak for most of last week with my Vue side-project but decided to let it go over the weekend. I'll still continue with the side-project but found myself forcing small commits just for the green squares - the fun had gone from it!
  - I posted [a blog post musing about CV-Driven-Development](/blog/2019-05-15-cv-driven-development/). I'd like to write more wordy, opinion-based posts but get lost in them. I definitely don't feel confident enough to cross-post this one anywhere, for example. Practice makes perfect though.

Second week of maternity leave complete, and I haven't felt the need to keep up-to-date with tech Twitter or read any of the [coding newsletters](/blog/2018-10-03-using-email-newsletters-to-stay-up-to-date-with-web-development/) that keep arriving in my inbox just yet. I'm still getting used to the lack of strict routine for 5/7 days and also spending a lot of time catching up on baby preparations that I've been ignoring while I was still working.
