I was on someone's personal site a while back, and in the footer alongside their social links it said "This website does not track you" - i.e. there isn't any Google Analytics, etc. I suppose they pointed this out because they were proud of it, but I personally wouldn't turn the tracking analytics off my own website. I like the data too much and I think it's useful and interesting to see what pages are being hit.
