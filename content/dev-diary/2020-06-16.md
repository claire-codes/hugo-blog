- "[Using target='_blank' the right way](https://www.manjuladube.dev/target-blank-security-vulnerability) - This is a common security vulnerability that is easy to fix. Add `rel='noopener noreferrer'` to any `_blank` links. I don't open my links in new tabs normally but noticed that my RSS feed was set to do this, so I added those attributes."
- "[Better (more accessible) active link styling](https://gomakethings.com/better-more-accessible-active-link-styling/) - Explains that  when you highlight a link with CSS to say 'you are on this page', screen readers don't benefit from this and suggests using `aria-current` instead. I definitely want to do this on my website!"
- "[Form design: multiple inputs versus one input](https://adamsilver.io/articles/form-design-multiple-inputs-versus-one-input/) - Adam's posts are always so interesting and this article reasons why using one input field is often more user-friendly."

I've started a new thing this week: spend 10 minutes a day learning. This is to break down the mental barrier that stops me doing online courses or learning a new technology. 10 minutes is easily achievable, and will hopefully lead to spending more than 10 minutes coding once I start and realise it isn't so bad after all! Of course by "learning" I mean specifically learn more about frontend tech!. I've started with a course on CSS Grid because I've been making excuses about learning it thoroughly for 2 years now.
