- "I finally allowed users to pinch and zoom into this website by [removing `maximum-scale=1` from the meta tag](https://github.com/claire-codes/hugo-blog/commit/b4bffbb1e100fd7b2c3d6a82540faa844a91755f). I ran a Lighthouse audit through Chrome and discovered this mistake - not sure why I wasn't allowing users to zoom except I'd copied and pasted the tag from somewhere."
- "[Atomic CSS-in-JS](https://sebastienlorber.com/atomic-css-in-js) - A good primer on the subject and it's made me want to try TailwindCSS in a project!"
- "[The case for * { margin: 20px }](https://dev.to/gajus/the-case-for-margin-20px-4m0d) - Maybe not something I'd do but an interesting approach to a site's layout."

The 10 minutes of code/learning a day thing has worked really well and I've got a good portion of the way through Wes Bos's CSS Grid course! I will definitely make this a habit. I've also discovered how much I actually already knew about CSS Grid just from reading blog posts and creating layouts with the help of Google: another example of lacking confidence in myself. My name is Claire and I know CSS Grid!
