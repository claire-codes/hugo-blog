- "I got a lot of comments on my last blog post about [how to prevent pasting into input fields](https://dev.to/claireparker/how-to-prevent-pasting-into-input-fields-nn). Users don't like this feature!"
- "I made [an Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtYWim9BATF/) reviewing my developer skills for the 10 year challenge that's viral on social media at the moment. There is quite a difference!"
- "[Convert a string to a number in JavaScript](http://thecodebarbarian.com/convert-a-string-to-a-number-in-javascript.html) - I didn't realise there was a different between `NaN` and `Number.NaN` in JavaScript, although I'm not surprised either!"
- "[Adding generators to your Gatsby site with plop](https://dev.to/ekaoddlass/adding-generators-to-your-gatsby-site-with-plop-2gd5) - this is a useful tool and I'd like to do it for this Hugo blog since I can't get archetypes to work!"
- "[Dissecting Front-end Job Titles](https://blog.prototypr.io/dissecting-front-end-job-titles-7f72a0ef0bc5) - this is an interesting explanation of different job titles in the frontend sector."
