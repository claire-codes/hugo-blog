- I really started to understand currying with help from [this article](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2016/12/06/currying-functions). I put the theory into practice on a React app at work and the concepts finally began to sink in!
- I published an article about sticky sidebars on both [Medium](https://medium.com/@clairepj/making-a-sticky-sidebar-with-two-lines-of-css-280169eac624) and [here on my blog](/blog/2018-04-02-making-a-sticky-sidebar-with-two-lines-of-css/)
- I offically moved my blog off Jekyll and onto Hugo, using a new theme I wrote myself ðŸ’ª It's served on Netlify which made all the hosting tasks and adding https really easy!
