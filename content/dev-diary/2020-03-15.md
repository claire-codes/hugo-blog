I've been volunteering once a week for the last month at a high school in Liverpool with [InnovateHer](https://www.innovateher.co.uk/) to help deliver a course about game development to year 9's (13 - 14 year olds). It's taken me right out of my comfort zone and also back into the adult world. As part of the course, we visited the Sony PlayStation offices in Wavertree which I found **so cool**, even though it was basically an average office, albeit one with PlayStation controllers on every desk.
