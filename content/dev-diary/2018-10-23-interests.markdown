- üéÉ Nearly three quarters of the way through Blogtober. I didn‚Äôt manage to get as much written this week as I‚Äôd like, and was 7 posts behind at one point! This is definitely forcing me to write shorter and more concise posts, and even split some post ideas into two. This is good though - short concise posts are easier to read. [All my Blogtober posts are listed here](/blog/2018-10-01-blogtober-2018/).
- "üîÄ I published a [Chrome extension on the Chrome store this week](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sbat-tabs/dglgfkacmokpgmbjojmgbmceofenjngg)! The extension itself is fairly trivial: it reverses the current order of your tabs - it's called 'Sbat tabs' geddit? It took longer than I expected to publish though! Making the icon and a screenshot for the Chrome store was harder for me than writing code."
- üìö [This post by Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/sass-selectors-to-nest-or-not-to-nest/) talked about the pros and cons of nesting selectors in Sass, and seemed to conclude with how difficult they are to search for if the `&` selector is used.
- "‚ö°Ô∏è I used a couple of techniques from [this blog post](https://css-tricks.com/html-elements-unite-the-voltron-like-powers-of-combining-elements/) to make my HTML in blog posts more semantic this week: the `<kbd>` element when explaining keyboard shortcuts ([seen here](/blog/2018-10-16-jumping-around-the-command-line/)), and the `<abbr>` for acronyms ([used here](/blog/2018-10-19-sass-or-scss/))."
- üé• I revisited [this CSS Tricks blog post](https://css-tricks.com/screen-recording-utilities-for-macos/) for ideas on screen recording for blog posts. I‚Äôve settled on Giphy Capture for now, which you can see in action in [this blog post](/blog/2018-10-16-jumping-around-the-command-line/).
