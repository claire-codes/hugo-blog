doing:
- "Learning all about Variants in Figma. It makes building components much neater, even something as simple as a radio button with selected and unselected states."
reading:
- "[Do accessible websites still need to support Internet Explorer 11?](
https://www.hassellinclusion.com/blog/should-accessible-websites-still-support-ie11/) - Yes according to the article, due to screen reader support."
- "[How to Fall In Love With Single Div Illustrations](https://dev.to/albertwalicki/how-to-fall-in-love-with-single-div-illustrations-1a5) - Almost an introduction to the art of creating pictures with one div. I love this kind of thing!"
watching:
- "[Figma Tutorial: Variants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29Xwt9dET0) - From the Figma YouTube channel. Figma's YouTube content is really well done and this is a great intro to Variants."

I took part in a blind coding challenge this week with my other frontend colleagues. We paired up and had 30 minutes to recreate a design in CodePen using only CSS and HTML. The catch was that we hid the live preview screen, and viewed the result only after the time was up together with the rest of the team. It was fun and the results varied a lot!
