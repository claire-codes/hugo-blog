doing:
- "Trying to rebuild a blogging habit by setting a timer for 10 minutes and spending it writing. I don't manage it every day but when I do it works and end up typing for 20 minutes or more."
reading:
- "[Operator Lookup](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/operator-lookup/) - I don't bookmark many tools but this one I have: an explanation of all the operators in JavaScript made of symbols you can't google., like \"?.\""
- "[Tailwind versus BEM](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/tailwind-versus-bem) - I love comparison pieces although I often finish them wondering which thing is better, like I did with this one!"

Entering a third lockdown in the UK and I feel at peace with it this time round. The stress of Christmas is over, I had a good break from work and now for at least six weeks I'm not to leave my house, unless for exercise or supermarket trips. No, I'm not pleased that I can't go anywhere or see anyone, but removing the uncertainty of the situation makes me feel calmer for now. And this time round at least I'm working, so I get to spend some mental energy thinking about building websites instead of worrying about the world.
