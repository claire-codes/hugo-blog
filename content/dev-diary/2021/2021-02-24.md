We've got several more weeks of lockdown in the UK ahead of us and it sapped my enthusiasm for hobbies this week. My solution to these low moods? Exercise, but really quick sessions that I can easily fit into my day. There's tonnes of short, free workouts available on YouTube which are all I need to release a few endorphins, or get me out of that mid-afternoon energy slump while working from home. I try a 10 minute (beginners) yoga workout, or a 5 minute arm routine, or even just 12 squats when I need a pick-me-up.
