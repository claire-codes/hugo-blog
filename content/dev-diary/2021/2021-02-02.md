doing:
- "[Font-face and Styled Components](/blog/2021-02-01-font-face-and-styled-components/) - Published my first blog post of the year. Nothing ground-breaking, just wanted to document a process for my future self (which is a really good reason to blog if you need one!)."
reading:
- "[Alt vs Figcaption](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/alt-vs-figcaption) - Explains the difference between the two. Figcaptions that appear on a screen should be illustrative and editorial, whereas alt text is functional. I also learned that a blank alt makes screenreaders ignore images."
- "[Guidelines for choosing React Libraries](https://maxrozen.com/guidelines-for-choosing-react-libraries/) - Useful points to consider before blindly installing another 3rd party library into your project."
- "[SuperTinyIcons GitHub Repo](https://github.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/) - Love the ethos behind this project and all the tiny code golfed SVG icons!"

I've been a Mac user for both work and personal use since 2015, but sadly (for me) my current workplace only uses Windows. Back to the world of ctrl-alt-delete for me! I keep forgetting that Windows file paths use back slashes `\` compared to the Mac/Linux forward slash `/`. I'm having a hard time remembering all my keyboard shortcuts for Mac VSCode too! I'm not fluently bilinugal in operating systems quite yet.
