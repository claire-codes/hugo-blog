doing:
- "Spending some focussed time creating ideas for content. I love posting content for lots of reasons (most of them healthy and not narcissistic!) but struggle to come up with ideas lately. There's no shame in spending some time coming up with ideas in advance which can make the process easier."
reading:
- "[Respecting Usersâ€™ Motion Preferences](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/respecting-users-motion-preferences/) - I improved the CSS for [how I handle smooth scroll on this site](https://github.com/claire-codes/hugo-blog/commit/2e3be51aa16456bb2d5566d3debcc86a0c5dc4fe) after reading this. Just like doing mobile first, we should add animation within a media query only if users have no motion preference."
- "[Color and contrast, what does it mean?](https://www.erikkroes.nl/blog/color-and-contrast/) - A good explanation of how colour contrast ratios work, something that I use all the time in my current role"

I revisited the codebase of this blog recently for the first time in months and was very grateful for the Readme file. Past-Claire had written enough instructions so that Future-Claire could get developing quickly. This is your regular reminder to create documentation for whoever maintains the code after you, even it's yourself!
