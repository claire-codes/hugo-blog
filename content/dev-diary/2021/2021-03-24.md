- "Posted my first Figma-themed blog post, describing [a method to create a border on one side of a rectangle](/blog/2021-03-24-one-sided-borders-in-figma/)"
reading:
- "[front-of-the-front-end and back-of-the-front-end web development](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development) - A mouthful but it defines the classification of frontend development very well. I'm definitely more front."
- "[Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) - This is a more useful resource than the handful of StackOverflow posts I revisit when I make a mistake in Git"

I use Google Keep to keep track of ideas for blog posts, Instagram posts and coding projects: maybe a new CSS feature I'd like to tinker with or a feature idea for my blog. Unfortunately my Keep account has evolved into a graveyard for ideas. I'm determined not to waste these little thoughts so lately I've been sorting through them and salvaging what I can for inspiration. However a lot of ideas just go stale - my interests and opinions change quickly and I should learn to strike while the iron is hot in the future (I won't though!).
