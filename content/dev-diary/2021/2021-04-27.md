doing:
- "Following [Stephanie Eckles's Build An Eleventy (11ty) Site From Scratch on Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3) - I love Egghead courses because they are waffle-free, and this particular course is free too!"
reading:
- "[My Top Ten Tips for Surviving and Thriving in Developer Relations](https://thebeebs.net/2021/03/02/my-top-ten-tips-for-surviving-and-thriving-in-developer-relations/) - The tip that resonated with me the most was that every post can be turned into another content form."
- "[The styled-components Happy Path](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/styled-components/) - I always learn something new from a Josh Comeau article so I was excited when he published this one about styled-components. I'm definitely keeping the advice about [Isolated CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/styled-components/#isolated-css) in mind next time I build a component."
watching:
- "[The Golden Ratio | Principles of Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEsS4Dl5KGM) - From the Figma YouTube channel. I've encountered the Golden Ratio before, but this video has made the idea click for me and now I've started looking for it everywhere!"
- "[THE GAP by Ira Glass](https://vimeo.com/85040589) - From Daniel Sax on Vimeo. It's only 2 minutes long and a feast for the eyes, go and watch it, especially if you're trying to get better at design like me!"

When I started working from home last year I bought myself a standing desk. It's a basic model from Ikea with a manual crank to adjust the height. I really like using it, but on busy days I often forget to change the height and end up sitting all day! Another thing no one tells you is that you need to build up your stamina: I could barely manage half an hour standing when I started. But the best reason for me to have a tall standing desk is that I can keep my computer out the way and safe from my inquisitive toddler!
