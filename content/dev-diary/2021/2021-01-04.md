doing:
- "Customising my terminal prompt: `claireparker-jones@Claires-MacBook-Air` just won't cut it! My new MacBook is on Big Sur, which uses zsh as the default shell instead of bash. This meant I couldn't easily copy-and-paste my existing custom prompt. It was a fun job though, and I'm pleased with the new format: `date time | path relative to home | branch >`"
- "[Posted to Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJoJRehAee2/) again after a long hiatus. It's nice to reconnect with my virtual pals during another lonely lockdown."
reading:
- "[Accessible icon links
](https://hugogiraudel.com/2020/12/10/accessible-icon-links/) -  This was a great reminder of how to create those little icon button-links correctly, but I particularly liked the way code snippets were commented with a warning as incomplete at the beginning of the post. Useful!"
watching:
- "[Creating Digital Content, Ladybug Podcast](https://www.ladybug.dev/episodes/creating-digital-content) -  If you don't listen to all of the episode (and you should, it's really insightful if you're a creator), just listen to the beginning where women talk about their huge numbers of followers and views and subscribers, without being apologetic or self-deprecating about it and just owning their success - it's SO REFRESHING and I loved it. I want an entire podcast where it's just successful women casually listing their achievements!"

It's like old times again, posting my Dev Diary during another UK-wide lockdown! Only this time I'm working instead of being a full-time mum and the weather is awful. Luckily nursery is still open so I can continue work uninterrupted, but the freezing weather and dark evenings are making this isolation much more difficult. YouTube workout videos and lunchtime dog walks have become essential on workdays to keep my morale up.
