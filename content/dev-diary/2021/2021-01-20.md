doing:
- "I'm determined to master SVG icons: to understand why they never look how I want them too! I'm learning a lot about viewBox this week and creating icons of my own in Figma and exporting them to practice."
reading:
- "[Parent accessibility](https://axesslab.com/parent-a11y/) - This was a fun read as a parent and a developer! It also contains a wonderful graphic explaining the difference between permanent, temporary and situational disabilities."
- "[No cookie for you](https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/) - GitHub explains that they no longer have cookie banners because ... they don't use non-essential cookies! Sort of blew my mind."
watching:
- "[Figma in 5: Vectors I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGBIc6oJCos) - I had to keep pausing to scribble down notes, I learnt so much from this video!"

I'm trying to decide whether to buy a protective case for my one month old MacBook Air. Although I try to be extra careful how I handle it, an accident is bound to happen soon, especially with a toddler around who likes throwing things. I used a plastic shell case with my last MacBook, but it didn't fit completely snug and ended up with grit trapped in it that scratched the case! Maybe I should just be respectful of this very sophisticated piece of equipment, and use it at a desk instead of my lap on the sofa where it wouldn't need so much protection.
