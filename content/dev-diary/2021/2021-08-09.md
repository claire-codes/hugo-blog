It's been over three months since I published something on the internet! Did I even exist for that period of time?? The reason for not being on the internet was being out in the real world instead. The UK has gradually eased lockdown restrictions since Spring and at the time of writing we are the most pre-pandemic than we've been since March 2020. Workwise this means I've been able to return to an office! Really enjoying the spontaneity of in-person conversations and the posh coffee-maker. So as my routine is changed up again, let's see if I can create content a little more regularly - maybe I'll make use of my new commute.
