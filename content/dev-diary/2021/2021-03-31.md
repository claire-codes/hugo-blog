- "[Variants â€“ a quick tip for better React components](https://swizec.com/blog/variants-a-quick-tip-for-better-react-components) - I immediately recognised this as something I'd fallen into and thought the solution was great."
- "[The Beauty Of Tiny Enhancements In CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/tiny-enhancements-in-css) - Emphasizing the point that a site doesn't have to look the same on every browser or device and this shouldn't stop you using new features."

I consider deleting my Twitter account quite a lot - I never tweet or interact with others on it. I only use it on my laptop which minimises the time I spend on it, but nevertheless I waste too much time reading people moaning in 280 characters or less. But it still has a strong tech community, plus every now and again someone retweets an old blog post of mine to say it had helped them, which I love! Perhaps I'll refocus it instead as a glorified RSS feed and publicise blog posts instead.
