doing:
- "Making slow but steady progress in my 10 minutes writing per day habit. Mananged 3/7 last week."
reading:
- "[Naming Styled Components](https://medium.com/inturn-eng/naming-styled-components-d7097950a245) - an older article with a valid suggestion for naming styled-components: instead of 'StyledElement' use a namespace like 'S.Element'."
- "[Creating websites with prefers-reduced-data](https://polypane.app/blog/creating-websites-with-prefers-reduced-data) - a new media query that's not supported yet but will be soon. Has a really thorough explanation of how to use and suggests some use cases: loading custom fonts, background images, video autoplay, or using infinite scroll."
- "[A placeholder is not a label HTMHell](https://www.htmhell.dev/24-a-placeholder-is-not-a-label/) - I agree! Just use a label and input!"

I feel pretty experienced in building a website at this point in my life, but every time I have to add a font to a project I have to google every step of it! Then I spend another few painful minutes making sure my file import paths are correct (and cursing myself for not setting up absolute imports) and I question whether I ever knew how to code at all. Admittedly this gets a little quicker each time, as I can pick out the blog post on installing fonts that I've read several times before in my search results.
