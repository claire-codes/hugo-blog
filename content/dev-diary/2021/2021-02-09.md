- "[Published my 2020 review](/blog/2021-02-09-2020-review/) - I've written three of these now and I ppst them later and later each year. I found quite a lot to talk about considering 2020 was the year that wasn't"
reading:
- "[Decent Patterns](https://notchris.net/patterns/) - As a lover of CSS gradients I found these patterns created by unicode characters really cute!"
- "[Alt-Text as Poetry](https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/) - Worth reading about the developers' mission with this project, but also all the thought that went into their web design choices for the site."
- "[The Rules of Margin Collapse](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/rules-of-margin-collapse) - I love Josh's articles: they are unashamedly long and detailed but contain so much interactivity and joy when teaching a subject."

What do all the cool kids use for building their personal sites nowadays? I see more and more declaring "Built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)" in the footer, rather than Gatsby, which used to be the framework everyone talked about. The current iteration of clairecodes uses Hugo, which is built in Go. I'm no Gopher (was going to learn as a hobby but never got round to it) but it doesn't stop me from accomplishing everything I need to with Hugo, and it's very fast. If it ain't broke, don't rebuild it, as we should say in web development more often.
