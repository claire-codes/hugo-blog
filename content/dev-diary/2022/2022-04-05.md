I haven't posted any content for so long that I've become afraid of publishing again. I lose my nerve and inevitably my confidence and go back to square one where I feel I have nothing to share. This is after blogging and working in tech for A Long Time Now (8 years I think?). So here I am writing about nothing in particular just to break the cycle and start posting again.
