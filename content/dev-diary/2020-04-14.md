- "I changed the colour of links on this website to a darker blue. I didn't realise it but the pale blue (#1E88E5) I was using gave a poor colour contrast against my white (#FFF) background that didn't meet the WCAG 2.0 level AA. Now with #391FE7 it's AAA."
- "[Why the GOV.UK Design System team changed the input type for numbers](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/) - The digital teams at GOV.UK do some great work, including this on why they moved away from the input type for numbers and replaced it with 'inputmode'."
- "[The problem with snackbars and what to use instead](https://adamsilver.io/articles/the-problem-with-snackbars-and-what-to-use-instead/) - Snackbars are the little tooltips of information that appear and disappear as you interact with a page. I'd always felt they were sometimes unhelpful because they vanish so quickly and this post gives a lot of good reasons to avoid them."
- "[whocanuse.com](https://whocanuse.com/) - This is another great tool for working with colour contrast and gives additional information on different vision types than my go-to WebAIM one."

Week 4! It's like a real life Groundhog Day experience. I post more consistently to Instagram lately and interact with other users more, probably since I can't talk to anyone in real life aside from my husband and baby! I wouldn't go so far as to say Instagram is a source of strength and support, but it helps pass the time.
