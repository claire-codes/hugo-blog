- "I've been reading about variable fonts in [this thorough blog post](https://www.zeichenschatz.net/typografie/how-to-start-with-variable-fonts-on-the-web.html) and getting excited about them. [This site has lots of cool examples](https://v-fonts.com/)."
- I'd investigated whether CSS selector efficiency is something to be worried about previously, and [this blog post](https://www.sitepoint.com/optimizing-css-id-selectors-and-other-myths/) concludes the same that I did - not really with our modern browsers.
- I created [an archery target using CSS Grid](https://codepen.io/claireparker/pen/JZqMRy) which I was pretty proud of - I'm still getting used to Grid and learning its capabilites.
- But then I read [this article](https://css-tricks.com/more-unicode-patterns/) about patterns made with unicode characters and Grid and my mind was blown.
