- ✏️ I _finally_ wrote a blog post about [how arrays are interpreted in template literals](blog/2018-09-08-template-literals-an-arrays/) in JavaScript.
- ✏️ I made a [page of links](click-me/) pointing to my different profiles on the web to use in my Instagram bio. This is like the Linktree service, but I wrote it myself and have full control over it.
- "📚 All of the gov.uk posts about accessibility are interesting, but the bit that stuck out in [this post about users who change colours on websites](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/01/supporting-users-who-change-colours-on-gov-uk/) was about how you can't even create a triangle with the CSS border technique and assume your users will see it - take nothing for granted!"
- '📚 [This blog post called "The Web is Made of Edge Cases"](https://codepen.io/tigt/post/the-web-is-made-of-edge-cases) reiterates this and is a good reminder to build resilient sites.'
- 📚 I enjoyed reading [this blog post about creating accessible web comics](https://axesslab.com/accessible-comics/).
- "⚡️ [Sara Soueidan's post](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write) was very pertinent and inspiring: just write that blog post!!"

It’s been a quiet couple of months for me online. I haven't had much inclination to code or blog over the summer, or even [post to Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/claire_codes) regularly. But this isn't the first time I've lost interest in coding. I just go with it and eventually I rediscover my enthusiasm for all this web development stuff instead of forcing it and having it become a chore. I finally squeezed a blog post out of my brain though which hopefully marks the end of my drought. It's been a full 3 months on here since I last wrote a blog post!
