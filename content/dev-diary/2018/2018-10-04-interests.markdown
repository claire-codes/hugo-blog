- "ðŸ‘« Gaining lots of new people to follow on Github from the caption of the aforementioned photo. I've been feeling lonely on my GitHub newsfeed for what feels like years, and I thought the best solution was to ask my Instafam for some help! It worked out really well! ðŸ˜„"
- "ðŸŽƒ I want to do Blogtober, but it's not going well with my holiday right at the beginning of October! We'll see if I can catch up over the next few days."
- "ðŸ–¥ [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) has released version 2 which is very exciting! I'll be upgrading [my sandbox React app](https://github.com/claireparker/react-app-playground) to take advantage of all the new features ASAP!"
