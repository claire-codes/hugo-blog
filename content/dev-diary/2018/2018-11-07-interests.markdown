interests:
- ðŸŽƒBlogtober finished over a week ago and I completely lost interest in it over the last few days ... it was a tough challenge towards the end but I'm glad to have finished so many half-completed blog posts that were languishing on my hard drive! I'll be writing a summary post soon.
- 'ðŸ“± I love [this app that tells you how long a technology has been out for](https://dev.to/jsrn/you-want-how-many-years-experience-4jl4?fbclid=IwAR1j6hGakXMQGjzuyvTLVVfO3GFYV27aL_zSxML6rlYHObti6UHGwm1WYDY): it helps avoids recruiters asking for ten years of React experience!'
- ðŸ’ªI made a small PR to the project to add Redux and Magento to it - since this was in October it meant that I actually made a PR for Hacktoberfest! (Only need four more for my t-shirt â€¦ )
- âœ¨ Border radius can take loads of values, which [this project](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/#12.50.12.50--) illustrates really well.
- ðŸ›¡ I drew a shield in Codepen using only CSS. I achieved the shape by using border-radius like in the project above.

I'm writing this from departures of the airport: I'm travelling to Paris to attend dotCSS after winning a ticket giveaway held by Women Who Code! Very excited, expect a blog post soon!
