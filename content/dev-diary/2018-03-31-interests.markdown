- I bought my husband a custom url for his birthday and put some silly content on it. I used CSS Grid for the first time to build it! [ant33t.rocks](https://claire-codes.github.io/ant33t/)
- "I learnt not to put quotes around generic font-families like `sans-serif`, i.e. don't do `font-family: 'sans-serif'` - this won't work! [You don't even need quotes around font-families with spaces in their name](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-font-family)"
- I've published some new [blog](blog/2018-03-13-deleting-multiple-local-git-branches-with-grep/) [posts](blog/2018-03-16-styling-inline-code-tags/), even [one that I'd started 4 months ago](blog/2018-03-19-reasons-not-to-use-ids-in-css/) (why has this took me so long?!)
