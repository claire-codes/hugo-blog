interests:
- I added a fallback for browsers that can't render CSS Grid to [ant33t.rocks](https://claire-codes.github.io/ant33t/) with Flexbox and the `@supports` rule. Fallbacks don't have to look identical - they should provide a usable experience.
- I learnt to avoid using [index for React list keys](https://www.menubar.io/react-keys-index) because of their unreliability.
- I read about [CSS rendering and the CSSOM](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-css-works-parsing-painting-css-in-the-critical-rendering-path-b3ee290762d3) and found it really interesting - browser performance is something I know I should have a deeper knowledge of but always neglect.
