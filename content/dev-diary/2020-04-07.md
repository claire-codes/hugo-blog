- "I had a fan-girl moment when Chris Coyier liked my article about [CSS polka dot backgrounds on Dev.to](https://dev.to/clairecodes/how-to-create-a-polka-dot-background-with-css-23m0) and followed me. He also followed me on Codepen and my polka dot pen made it to the homepage of picked pens! This was something I wrote back in summer 2018 which shows content can build traction over time :) I've noticed the polka dot post has received much more interaction lately and I'd love to know why!" 
- "I added the &lt;article&gt; HTML tag to my blog after reading [Why You Should Choose HTML5 article Over section](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/html5-article-section). Content within the article tag should be standalone and able to be syndicated in another place, which lends itself well to blog posts. "
- "[New media queries you need to know](https://blog.logrocket.com/new-media-queries-you-need-to-know/) - I love all these new media queries, like prefers-reduced-data and dark-mode ones, but it makes me wonder how they would ever get implemented on a product without a lot of input from informed frontend developers?"
