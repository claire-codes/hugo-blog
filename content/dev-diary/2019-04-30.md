- "I wrote a new [blog post about how to replace normal bullet points with emoji](/blog/2019-04-26-styling-list-bullets-with-emoji/) and [cross-posted to dev.to](https://dev.to/claireparkerjones/styling-list-bullets-with-emoji-1733) - got a lot of positive reactions if not a lot of views!"
- "I finished the official [Google Analytics for Beginners](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6) course. It was kind of helpful (and didn't take too long) but basic since I'm familiar with the Analytics dashboard already. I'm still keen to improve me SEO so I think I'll take the next course soon."
- "I watched the Egghead course [Converting Sass to CSS-in-JS](https://egghead.io/courses/convert-scss-sass-to-css-in-js). I regularly use CSS-in-JS at work with a library but have a Sass background so this was interesting to me. The course doesn't use a library, but instead explains how to implement CSS-in-JS from scratch, which demystified the whole concept for me. It offers a way to write an app without Sass but still with the power of Sass. There are replacements for variables, mixins (an arrow function), default parameters, non-required argument order and variable numbers of arguments using the rest operator."
- "[Variable fonts](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/variable-fonts.html) - a good introduction to the subject, but I particularly liked his [gist for system fallback fonts](https://gist.github.com/don1138/5761014)."
- "[Sans Forgetica](https://sansforgetica.rmit/) is a font that was designed to help you remember your notes better - what a cool concept!"

I want to redesign my blog: add some new layouts and change the copy, especially the landing page. So I've made a commitment to myself to commit some code to it everyday until I'm happier with it. This means I can chip away at it gradually and make good progress ðŸ¤ž
