I'm having another go at Blogtober starting this week, where I post something every day through October. I haven't posted a Dev Diary for ages and in my made-up rules this will count towards my count of 31 posts this month.

What have I been up to? Professionally, I've moved from a design role back into a development role which has been very fun. The world of web development has changed a lot since 2019, but coding is like riding a bike. 

Personally, I'm building a small Astro project which is my first encounter with the framework - it's been simple and pleasant to get something working. However my progress has ground to halt now that I have to style the UI. I'll probably keep Astro's default fonts and colours just to get something shipped!
