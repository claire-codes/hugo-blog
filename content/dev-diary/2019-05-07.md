- "I've added meta descriptions to each page on my site. The hardest bit is deciding what to write!"
- "There's a few different ways that you can add a meta description to a layout in a Hugo site depending on the page type, so I [blogged about it here](/blog/2019-05-03-meta-descriptions-in-hugo-templates/) for reference."
- "According to my Google Analytics, I'm getting a lot of traffic through organic searches for the first time since I've started this site! Mainly to a very old article about [deploying an Angular 1 app on Heroku](/blog/2015-09-30-how-to-deploy-an-angular-app-on-heroku/), and also to [creating a polka dot background with CSS](/blog/2018-10-10-css-polka-dot-background/)."
- "[On Cultural Stagnation](https://www.ryn.works/blog/2019/04/24/on-cultural-stagnation) - worth a read as a manager or as someone lower down the food chain. I want to bookmark the list of things to look out for in your next job at the bottom of the post."
- "[No hello](http://www.nohello.com/) - a small site dedicated to teaching people not to start online chats with 'hello' or 'hi' then wait five minutes while you write out the actual reason behind the message. I totally agree and hate it when people do this, especially my line manager!"
- "[Controlling leftover grid items](https://css-irl.info/controlling-leftover-grid-items/) - I am definitely still a beginner with CSS Grid so these techniques are handy to know."
