interests:
- "[Emoji Shortcode Roulette](https://claire-codes.github.io/emoji-shortcode-roulette/) - I made a single-page site that generates a random emoji and its accompanying GitHub shortcode for fun."
- "[The two-value syntax of the CSS Display property](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/the-two-value-syntax-of-the-css-display-property/) - The display property in CSS is being refactored, so that flex => block flex and inline-flex => inline flex. This is only available in Firefox right now and should make this property easier to understand."
- "[Make your test fail](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/make-your-test-fail) - When doing TDD always begin with a failing test and then fix it, don't skip straight to green. I've been guilty of this myself."
- "[Inspiring high school students with HTML and CSS](https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/inspiring-high-school-students-tech) - I liked the author states she wants to be a visible female role model for girls. The author made a good point in that there isn't an easy way to be exposed to web dev, as most platforms girls use nowadays are customisation-free unlike MySpace etc in the old days."

The UK has entered lockdown today, so life outside has been cancelled for 3 weeks at least. I'm grateful to work in an industry mostly based on the internet, so I can still stay connected and keep my own skills relevant, even if I'm not currently employed.
