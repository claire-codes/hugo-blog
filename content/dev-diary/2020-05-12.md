I haven't posted to Instagram for a week although I still log on because it's nice to see how other virtual people are doing. I haven't felt like creating any dev content recently, but I know that if I do publish something it will make me feel better, so here I am writing my weekly dev diary! It's best to keep busy in times like this.
