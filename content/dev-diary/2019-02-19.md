I have done very little extra-curricular coding or writing this week but won't let that stop me writing this entry!

I've read lots of development-related blog posts since last week, but none resonated with me enough to share here. I haven't worked on any side projects (I'll be honest, I haven't done that enthusiastically for a while) nor have I written any blog posts. I've barely posted to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/claire_codes/) either. And that's OK! Coding is my day-job as well as my evening hobby, so sometimes I just need a break when I get home from the office.

I'm going on holiday later this week ðŸŒ´ and I'll take my laptop with me (I always travel with it) but we'll see whether I end up using it much!
