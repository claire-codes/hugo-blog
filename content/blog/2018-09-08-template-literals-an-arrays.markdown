Template literals ([or the feature formerly known as template strings in older versions of the spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)) are one of my favourite features of ES6. By quoting strings with backticks instead of quotes, we can now interpolate variables and create multiline strings. For example:

```js
const thing = "World";
`Hello
${thing}`;
// "Hello
// World"
```

(Anything preceded by `//` in the code examples indicates the return value of the expression.)

Variable interpolation occurs when you wrap a value in `${}`. The value could be a variable, function or even a type like a number or string. The expression is evaluated and the return value is used in the template literal. For a variable, this means the value of the variable is substituted. For a function, it gets executed and the result  is used.

I recently experienced some confusion around interpolation. When  the return value of the expression is an array, why are the array's square brackets removed in the result?

```js
const numberArray = [1, 2, 3];
`${numberArray}`;
// "1,2,3"
const gimmeArray = () => [];
`What array? ${gimmeArray()}`
"What array? "
```

This is easier to understand if you consider interpolation as "string substitution", as it's referred to in this [Google post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/01/ES6-Template-Strings). The array is being converted to a string before being substituted back into the template literal. This is also what happens when you call the `toString()` method on an array:

```js
[1,2,3].toString();
// "1,2,3"
[].toString();
// ""
```

Note that this only happens to arrays between the dollar and curly brackets. If you type bracket characters directly in the template literal, then they stay as they are.

```js
`[3,2,1]`
// "[3,2,1]"
```

OK, so what if I really really want the square brackets in my resulting string? (The problem that inspired this whole blog post: I wanted to write a dynamic GraphQL query that took an array as a field argument).

Surround the variable interpolation value with square brackets and problem solved:

```js
`[${[7,8,9]}]`
// "[7,8,9]"
```
