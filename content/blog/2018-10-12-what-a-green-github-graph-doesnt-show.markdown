The GitHub contributions graph is the dashboard visible on a user's GitHub profile page. It shows the number of contributions you've made to repositories over the past year. Contributions are marked on each day with a different shade of green, depending on how much you did that day relative to the rest of the year. A contribution can be:

- opening an issue
- creating a pull request
- reviewing a pull request
- making a code commit

Most of your contributions probably come from commits, especially when starting out and working on personal projects only.

It's really pleasing to see green on your graph. Maintaining a green chain of squares can be a powerful motivator for building a daily coding habit. It gamifies the whole process of writing and committing code each day.

It also gives an insight to potential employers and other curious people into how often you code, and can be considered in the hiring process. For me, this is an incorrect use of this graph.

Now I love the GitHub dashboard. I once managed [a streak of over 100 days](/blog/2016-04-10-a-101-day-github-streak)! But I would never use it as a metric when deciding how capable a developer someone is. Here are my reasons, focussing on commit contributions:

- Contributions don't represent effort or time spent. A commit could be a feature you spent two hours on, or it could be a quick-fix that took two minutes.
- Contributions don't represent lines of code. A commit that changes one character is represented the same way as a ten file commit on the graph. (Although please don't interpret this as me saying typos or documentation aren't important to fix - they are!)
- When you're trying to maintain a streak, it can discourage you from researching and studying new things, as you're focussed on spending time writing code instead. It also encourages you to do something that is worthy of being committed. Some days it can be more valuable to experiment and learn without building a fully fledged feature that can be committed to a codebase.
- It discourages you from using other platforms to create code. You can build amazing things on Glitch, CodePen, JSFiddle but not receive a green square for it.
- GitHub contribution history can be easily manipulated and faked. There are a tonne of tools out there that let you edit your past contributions, sometimes with arty effects like [this repo](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti):

A green GitHub contributions graph looks cool (at least in my opinion), and can help encourage you to build a daily coding habit. However, it isn't a reliable indicator of how capable or commited a developer is, or how much code they write. There are many valuable ways to learn and create as a developer at every ability level, and they do not all involve committing code. Don't be ashamed to have a mostly white graph.

That being said, images like this still make me happy:
