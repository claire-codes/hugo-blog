I tried this last year but got no further than the 1st October! Let's try again this year.

## What's Blogtober?

A challenge to publish a blog post every day thoughout October. I've [done this before in 2018](/blog/2018-10-01-blogtober-2018/) fairly successfully. Blog posts can be tutorials, tips or something more chatty and opinionated - just normal blog content. No minimum or maximum word count. Realistically I'll spend 1-2 hours on this a day so posts will be short and concise.

## Why do you want to do this?

To challenge myself to improve my writing and as part of the endless battle with my confidence. I love writing but I get stuck in a mental rut, endlessly redrafting a post and never publishing it. Currently I haven't posted anything since May. I'm not going to beat myself up about this since there's been a lot going on in the world this year and I haven't always felt like sitting at my computer and talking about code recently, but I enjoy writing and sharing content so hopefully this challenge will help rebuild writing as a habit.

I decided I wanted to attempt Blogtober again just a couple of days ago - I normally have lots of post ideas stored in a Trello board but since I haven't been writing regularly I'm starting this cold - no idea what I'm writing about tomorrow yet!

Maybe see you tomorrow with a brand new post???
