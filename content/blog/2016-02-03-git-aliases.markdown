How many times do type out the same repetitive commands for Git every day? Want to save some keystrokes? Use a Git alias. Consider the very useful but very long:

```bash
git log --graph --oneline --decorate
```

What a mouthful. But all you need to do, from any directory at the command line, is type:

```bash
git config --global alias.plog 'log --graph --oneline --decorate'
```

Then from then on all you need to type is:

```bash
git plog
```

And this gives you the same output as the full version.

Git aliases are like shortcuts to common tasks. You can even alias already short commands, e.g.:

```bash
git config --global alias.s status
```

And this gives you the super quick:

```bash
git s
```

But wait! There's more!

I find myself wanting to add everything to staging in the current directory _except_ one particular file or folder. This can be cumbersome, adding everything separately and awkwardly avoiding that one pesky file. But there's a quicker way: add everything, then unstage the thing you don't want in the commit, for example `foo.txt`:

```bash
git add .
git reset foo.txt
```

Then quickly type `git status` - wait, I mean, `git s` now isn't it? - to verify before `git commit`-ing.

But that feels like a lot of keystrokes for what feels like one action (yes I am lazy). So let's take our time-saving to new level and write a script to do it for us. I'm using a Mac with Bash installed, so I've put the following script in `/usr/local/bin` and called it `allExcept`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

git add .
git reset $1
git status
```

I run `chmod 777` against the script to make sure it's executable, then all I need to call the script. I type the name of the script followed by the filename to exclude, like:

```bash
allExcept dont-add-me.txt
```

The `$1` is the first argument to the script. The commands are executed and the status of the repo is printed out to the console. Boom! üëäüí• What else could you create a shortcut for? It doesn't have to be Git-related, it could be any sequence of shell commands. üêö
