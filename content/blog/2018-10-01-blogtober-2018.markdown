Blogtober is a challenge that people with too much time on their hands undertake, where they pledge to write one blog post a day for all 31 days of October. It is a Thing: I googled it and found other people doing it. I want to do it this year because:

- I have an ever-expending list of 20+ post ideas that I never get round to writing
- I take too long to write a post, agonising over my words. I want to be able to get content out quicker and I imagine this challenge will help me practice this.
- Practice makes perfect and I want to get better at writing blog posts.

My posts will cover the same subjects that they have over the last few months: explaining code snippets or tricks in CSS, JavaScript and other tools I use daily as a frontend web developer. I might start doing more opinion-based posts too.
