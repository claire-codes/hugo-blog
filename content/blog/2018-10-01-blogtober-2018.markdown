## What is Blogotber?

Blogtober is a challenge where you pledge to write one blog post a day for each of they thirty-one days of October. I guess it was designed by someone with too much time on their hands.

I want to do it this year because:

- I have an ever-expanding list of 20+ post ideas that I never get round to writing
- I take too long to write a post, agonising over my words. I want to be able to get content out quicker and I imagine this challenge will help me improve at this.
- Practice makes perfect and I want to get better at writing blog posts.

My posts will cover the same subjects that they have over the last few months: explaining code snippets or tricks in CSS, JavaScript and other tools I use daily as a frontend web developer. I might start doing more opinion-based posts too.

## Blogtober 2018 posts

- **1st October**: Introduction post (this one!)
- **2nd October**: [Simple vs clever code style](/blog/2018-10-02-simple-vs-clever-code-style)


Let's see if I can keep it up!
