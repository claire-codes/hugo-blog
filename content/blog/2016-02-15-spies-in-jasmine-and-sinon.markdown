So you're testing. In JavaScript. Perhaps you want to test:

* whether a method has been called
* what arguments the method was called with
* what the method returns

A reasonable request. You turn to your testing framework and it turns back to you and it says "Bob, you need to use a spy." Fine.

Maybe you have to use Jasmine as your testing framework at work, but really you find Mocha + Chai more readable, so you use that for your personal projects. Fine, your choice. Just don't forget that Mocha doesn't come with spies built-in, so you need to use another library to provide that. You choose Sinon because ... well, everyone else does so it's easy to find answers on StackOverflow. Fine. But _then_ you make the na√Øve mistake of thinking the APIs for Mocha/Chai/Sinon and Jasmine are the same! Nope. Observe.

## Jasmine Spy !== Sinon Spy

### Spies

We set a spy on a method so that we can tell whether it's been called, or record what arguments it was called with. The difference is that a Sinon spy calls the original implementation of a method **by default**, whereas you have to **explicitly request** this behaviour with Jasmine:

| Jasmine | Sinon |
| --- | --- |
| `spyOn(foo,'bar').and.callThrough()` | `sinon.spy(foo,'bar')` |

*N.B. The new chainable syntax in Jasmine 2.0*

What does this mean? It means that when you spy on the `bar()` method, the actual method still executes. The alternative in Jasmine is just to call `spyOn(foo,'bar')`, which will just stub `bar()`: it will be called, and it won't throw an error, but the actual `bar()` method itself will not run.

### Stubs

How about if you want to 'stub' out the return value of your method, so that it returns a set value every time? The Jasmine and Sinon syntax is different for this too:

| Jasmine | Sinon |
| --- | --- |
| `spyOn(foo,'bar').and.returnValue(42)`| `sinon.stub(foo,'bar').returns(42)` |

Sinon's API makes use of a different method now, `stub()`, whereas Jasmine chains onto the original 'spy', but they both do effectively the same thing.

### What's your point?

You say tomato, I say tomato. üçÖ

One man's stub üîé is another man's mock üîç, which is another person's spy üîé, which is another person's test double üîç. When you assume that you know that you know what that testing framework is talking about, you make an __ASS__ out of __U__ and __ME__.

_This post was inspired by the day I lost wondering why my Jasmine spy wasn't behaving how I thought it should. Curse you `.and.callThrough()`!!_
