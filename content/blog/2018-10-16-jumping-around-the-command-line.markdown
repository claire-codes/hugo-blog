Next time you find yourself pressing the arrow key to move to the end of the command line, stop and remember, there is a quicker way! Here are a few quick shortcuts to make your cursor movement more efficient.

_Note_: These are written for a Mac - swap out the Cmd button for your OS-specific alternative (e.g. Cmd on Windows). These were tested in Terminal and iTerm2 using a Bash shell. Your mileage may vary for different setups.

## Jump to the end of a line

<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd>

## Jump to the beginning of a line

<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>

This gif illustrates these two keyboard shortcuts in action:

## Skip over a word

<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>&larr;</kbd>

If you're using iTerm2, you may need to configure the "alt" key to work as expected. Check out my blog post about [enabling the alt key in iTerm2](/blog/2018-10-15-making-the-alt-key-work-in-iterm2/) for how to do that.

This gif shows using the alt key to move the cursor over whole words:

## Clear window

Bonus tip: how to clear the contents from the viewport of the terminal window.

<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> or just type `clear` and press enter.
