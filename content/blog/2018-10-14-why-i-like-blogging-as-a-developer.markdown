summary: Instead of telling you why you should blog, I list reasons that I enjoy maintaining a software development blog.

Every software developer should blog in my opinion. If there are ever a set of qualifications or standards needed to be a qualified developer, then I definitely think that writing technical blog posts should be an assessed skill (alongside good verbal communication and empathy, but that's a different blog post ...).

But today, instead of a post telling you why you should start blogging, I've decided to list some of the reasons that I enjoy blogging, as well as take a short trip down memory lane.

I started this blog in September 2015. It was first built using Octopress and deployed on Heroku. My first domain was `claireparkerpen.com`! I chose Octopress on the recommendation of a colleage at the time. I used to work with Ruby so it was a natural choice: geared towards beginners, themes built-in and written in Ruby.

I soon felt ready to try a more advanced blog. I moved to Jekyll and had a lovely couple of years customising it. I used a pre-built theme. No one read my blog except me and a few recruiters. I transferred to the more mature `claireparker.co.uk` - a few months before getting married and changing my name to Claire Parker-Jones ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, oh well!

Then this year it was time for a rewrite. I'd long stopped using Ruby professionally and wanted to use one of the hot new blogging frameworks instead. I played with Gatsby but settled on Hugo as I wanted to start dabbling in Go. I rebranded to `clairecodes.com` which fit in with my Instagram account that I'd started in January 2018 and here we are. I built the theme and design from scratch and started blogging a bit more regularly.

Still, no one reads my blog. So why do I still publish posts on it and redesign it occassionally?

* It's fun
* I like writing
* It helps me learn whatever I'm writing about better
* It helps improve my writing and verbal communication, which is an undervalued skill in development
* I enjoy sharing knowledge, which I also think is a very important skill as a developer
* Maintaining the codebase of the blog rather than being hosted somewhere like Wordpress is a great portfolio piece, and the blog is a good sandbox for playing with designs or code snippets
* I created the blog and did everything on it myself - it may not be the best blog in the world but it's my pet project and I'm proud of it
* It comes in handy when applying for jobs - it makes you stand out from the crowd
* I often revisit my technical posts in order to remember how to do something! They are great cheatsheets.
* The content of the blog posts are a good way to measure my progress as developer
* I like having something published - even though my blog gets next-to-no traffic, there‚Äôs something about knowing that it‚Äôs live on the internet that‚Äôs different than having something sitting unpublished on your laptop.
* It's fun

These are my reasons for running a blog as a developer. I recommend you run one too and send me the linkso I can read your posts.
