What is CV Driven Development? I first overheard a colleague using the term self-deprecatingly, talking about their own career decisions. Googling the term doesn’t return a conclusive definition: the first page of search results contains ten links to ten different interpretations. The explanation I liked most was from https://martinjeeblog.com/2015/03/11/cv-driven-development-cdd/:

> CV Driven Development (CDD) is a software development process which prioritises design and development choices that will enhance the implementing programmer’s Curriculum Vitae over other potential solutions, regardless of how rational that choice is.

As a developer, what development choice would enhance your CV? For example, what tech would you choose if you're building the frontend of a website based on what would look good on your CV? Do you choose the JavaScript framework that appears in the most job-listings in your city, or offers the highest average salary, or is mentioned in the job spec of that company you’ve always wanted to work for?

Why do certain tech stacks look more attractive than others? Are there fewer jobs with language X or library Y? Maybe you want to challenge yourself with something new, or apply your existing skills with language X to a new domain? Perhaps you just feel that it’s fallen out of fashion.

When you started to learn programming, how did you choose which language to start with? If you weren't dictated by a curriculum, were your choices were influenced by potential job prospects and salaries in your city? When you’re a complete beginner in coding, it can be difficult to find a metric to help you decide whether to learn SQL or C++, when you’ve never worked with a database or built and API. Numbers of job adverts and prospective salaries are a tangible criterion that people can use.

The implication of this definition is that the project suffers in the long run with a poor choice of technologies. However, in the meantime, the developers working on the project are happy because they get to learn the latest shiny toy of their choice. If the technology is really unsuitable, it can give the next crop of employees a chance to refactor the project with their own tech stack, letting the circle of life of software development continue! Unfortunately, developers can sometimes be distracted by the tools they're working with rather than spending time solving the problem the software is supposed to fix.

Choosing technologies for commercial or even hobby projects is a difficult decision, and can understandably be motivated by what looks good on a developer’s CV. Your CV is your ticket to a well-paid, fulfilling job. It’s savvy to invest in your future by learning marketable skills, particularly if you can get paid to do so.
