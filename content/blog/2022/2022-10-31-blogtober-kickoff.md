## Blogtober 2022

I challenged myself to Blogtober 4 years ago in 2018 and ended up publishing 22 blog posts (out of 31) and finding it pretty fun too. [This page lists all my Blogtober 2018 posts](/blog/2018-10-01-blogtober-2018.markdown). I've completely lost my writing habit, so I thought the Blogtober challenge would be a great way to rediscover it. And maybe some of my half-finished draft posts may finally see the light of day.

I can't remember where I got the idea for Blogtober from, but here is what I expect from myself for the month:

 * To post 31 posts, one for each day of October from the 1st to the 31st
 * There's no minimum or maximum post length
 * Write about any subject I like! But most likely frontend web development or web design

The aim is to do better than [Blogtober 2019](/blog/2019-10-01-blogtober-2019/) where I posted a kick-off post on the 1st October and nothing else! 

I'll update this post with each new Blogtober post as a mini-contents page. And since I'm publishing this on the 1st October I get a nice easy one to ease me in! Wish me luck!
