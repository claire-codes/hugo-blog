Every software developer should blog in my opinion. If there are ever a set of qualifications or standards needed to be a qualified developer, then I definitely think that writing technical blog posts should be a required skill.

But instead of telling you why you should start blogging, I‚Äôve decided to list some of the reasons that **I** enjoy blogging, as well as take a short trip down memory lane.

## The history of clairecodes.com

I started this blog in September 2015. It was first built using Octopress and deployed on Heroku. My first domain was `claireparkerpen.com`! I chose Octopress on the recommendation of a colleage at the time. I used to work with Ruby so it was a natural choice: geared towards beginners, themes built-in and written in Ruby.

I soon felt ready to use a more advanced blogging platform. I moved to Jekyll and had a good experience with it. I would still recommend Jekyll today: it‚Äôs a very mature project, great documentation and strong community. You don‚Äôt need a lot of Ruby knowledge in order to create advanced features with it. I used an open-source theme as a starting point and customised it more and more over the two years I used Jekyll. I transferred my domain to the more mature `claireparker.co.uk` - a few months before getting married and changing my name to Claire Parker-Jones ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, oh well! No one read my blog except me and a few recruiters.

This year I felt it was time for a rewrite. I‚Äôd long stopped using Ruby professionally and wanted to play with one of the hot new blogging frameworks I was hearing so much about instead. I experimented with Gatsby, but settled on Hugo, as I wanted to start dabbling in Go. I rebranded to clairecodes.com to match my Instagram account that I‚Äôd started in January 2018. I built the theme and design from scratch and started blogging a bit more regularly. And this brings me up to date, three years later.

Oh, and still, no one reads my blog. I know because I check the Google Analytics!

## Why do I still maintain this blog?

* It‚Äôs fun
* It helps me learn the subject I‚Äôm writing about better, or crystallise my opinions
* It helps improve my writing and verbal communication, which is an undervalued and important skill in development
* I enjoy sharing knowledge, which I also think is a very important skill as a developer. This is my small way of giving back to the open source community.
* Maintaining the codebase of the blog, rather than using a ready-made platform like Wordpress, is a great portfolio piece, and the blog is a good sandbox for playing with designs or code snippets
* I created the blog from scratch and designed everything on it myself - it may not be the best blog in the world but it‚Äôs my pet project and I‚Äôm proud of it
* It comes in handy when applying for jobs - it makes you stand out from the crowd
* I often revisit my technical posts in order to remember how to do something. They are great cheatsheets.
* The content of the blog posts are a good way to measure my progress as developer
* I like having something published - even though my blog receives no traffic, there‚Äôs something about knowing that it‚Äôs live on the internet that‚Äôs different than having it sitting unpublished on my laptop.
* It‚Äôs fun - I've put this twice because this is the most important reason. If I didn‚Äôt enjoy it I wouldn‚Äôt continue doing it.

These are my reasons for running a blog and writing technical posts. If you‚Äôre a developer, I recommend you run one too - and send me the address so I can read your posts please!
