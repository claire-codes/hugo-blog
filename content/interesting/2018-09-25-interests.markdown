- "📚 I'm a huge fan of small, frequent commits, so I loved the message of this blog post: '[Do your commits pass this simple test?](https://dev.to/sublimegeek/do-your-commits-pass-this-simple-test-4ak2)'"
- "🤓 Did you know there are other whitespace codes in HTML other than `&nbsp;`?? I didn't, so [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8515365/are-there-other-whitespace-codes-like-nbsp-for-half-spaces-em-spaces-en-space) was really enlightening."
- 🤓 And the [`<samp>` HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp), ever come across that before?? Nope, me neither.
- "✨ Reading [wise words from Chris Coyer about dogmatism](https://css-tricks.com/increasing-wariness-dogmatism/) in the web development world. There's no right answer people!"
