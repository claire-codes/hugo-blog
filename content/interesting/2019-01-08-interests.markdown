  - "[Top 12 Things That Destroy Developer Productivity, Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/top-12-things-that-destroy-developer-productivity-2ddf0abc190?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWW1FMll6TXhPRFkzWW1JeiIsInQiOiJtb2hOTGFWcmtMbW9rVkF2dkVEc3I3NTF0XC9MQzVjTVdUaklKRUpsdTNwNkw4SDBWWFZTOVdIZ2NUT1dkb1wvbVNwRGVCNGZUWEJtYllPdlcwZ0hEelcrZTgrd3grZyt5dnNWM1Z4YU8yN3BSU1VhN3RPNGdaaU1CYm1FTURUY2JVIn0%3D)  - Number 8 on this list really resonated with me because of the project I'm working on at work right now.

  - "[Reluctant Gatekeeping: The Problem With Full Stack](https://medium.com/@Heydon/reluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack-e9ad836570f6) - anything by Heydon Pickering is worth a read, especially this piece about devaluing CSS within the frontend."
