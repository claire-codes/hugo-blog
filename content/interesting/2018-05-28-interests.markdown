- I wrote a guest blog post for [The Girl Code](https://www.instagram.com/thegirlcode2018/) about my experiences working as a developer in the tech industry. [You can read it by clicking here](https://medium.com/@girlscodetoo/finding-your-coding-niche-claire-parker-b6d1bf816773). I didn't realise I had so much to say about confidence and belief in yourself, nor that I'd worked with so many languages before writing them out!
- I took over the WomenInTech Snapchat account for TechTuesday! (It also got posted to their [Instagram stories](https://www.instagram.com/womenintech/)) It was a huge thing for me as I a) hadn't used Snapchat much before ðŸ˜± b) never post voice clips on Instagram c) struggle with selfies on a good day. But I did it! I think it went OK?? It's difficult to tell and I was too embarrassed to watch it back once I'd done it lol. But I got over the fear of speaking on camera and listening to myself back, plus I discovered I had a lot to talk about regarding tech blogging and CSS. Also gained a few new Instagram followers ðŸ˜‰
- GraphQL is my new nemesis (it used to be Redux). Going to have a lot of headaches this week as I get my head around it, all the while pairing on a big feature in work ðŸ˜–
