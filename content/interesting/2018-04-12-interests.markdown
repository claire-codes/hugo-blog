- I shared my first post on [dev.to](https://dev.to) about [why not to use IDs in CSS](https://dev.to/claireparker/reasons-not-to-use-ids-in-css-4ni4) and it was really well-received! So much more positive engagement compared to Medium!
- I learnt about Sass maps and looping over them to create dynamic styles and selectors
- I learnt how to use JavaScript Sets to return only unique values from an array with `Array.from(new Set(arr))`
