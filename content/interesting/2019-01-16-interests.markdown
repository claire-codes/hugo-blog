  - "[Why can’t we use Functional CSS and regular CSS at the same time?](https://css-tricks.com/why-cant-we-use-functional-css-and-regular-css-at-the-same-time/) - a really interesting discussion on CSS classnames."
  - "[‬In what way is JS any more maintainable than CSS?](https://gist.github.com/threepointone/731b0c47e78d8350ae4e105c1a83867d) - a gist explaining why this person likes CSS-in-JS. After using it for 9 months, I'm used to it but not completely sold on it yet."
  - "[event-stream vulnerability explained](https://schneid.io/blog/event-stream-vulnerability-explained/) - there was another npm package vulnerability last year. This post explains but it also suggests forking off popular packages and maintaining them yourself rather than blindly relying on 3rd partys to keep you safe."

I really enjoy writing an entry for this page each week, but the contents of each post has evolved and I think the page needs a rename. I initally set out for it to be a list of topics that I was working with or was interersted in working with, and would serve as inspiration. The best name I could come up with was "Interesting", because naming things is hard. Later I started listing blog posts that I'd enjoyed reading and also mentioned any projects or blog posts that I'd worked on that week. I now write a opinion on each blog post I read rather than "this was intersting". So now this page feels more like a journal to me. This week I'll rename the page to Dev Diary and rejig the layout, maybe adding some pagination to deal with all the entries I've accumulated.
