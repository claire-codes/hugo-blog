This week, one of the women I follow on Instagram (Leah of [@leah_lestrange](https://www.instagram.com/leah_lestrange/) posted her first blog post where she explained basic concepts about the internet in a simple way. [Read it here](http://leahquackenbush.com/i-dont-get-i-t-what-is-the-internet/). At the end of it she had a long list of developers and tech types to follow on Instagram. She included me in her list ðŸ¤©, and the description next to it listed me as a "Web Developer & Blogger". No one (except myself) had ever called me a blogger before and I was chuffed to see it in real life! I like being a blogger and Iâ€™m going to call myself this more often. Thanks Leah for this confidence boost!
