- I learnt how to mock function calls in Jest with [jest.fn()](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/mock-function-api.html)
- "[This dev.to post](https://dev.to/ice_lenor/one-useful-advice-to-fight-the-impostor-syndrome-3p8) about presenting your accomplishments proudly and stop being derogatory about yourself professionally really resonated with me. Hopefully I can follow this advice!"
- Kept up my streak of posting a blog post each week to dev.to. This week's was about [Sets](https://dev.to/claireparker/how-to-create-an-array-of-unique-values-in-javascript-using-sets-5dg6).
