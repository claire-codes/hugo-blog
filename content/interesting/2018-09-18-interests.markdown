interests:
- "🖋 I've downloaded Inkscape and started working through some beginner tutorials from Logos by Nick's Youtube channel. I'm really enjoying being a complete n00b with a tool like this again and can't wait to start creating my own SVG icons with it."
- "✏️ I've written two more blog posts this week, one [about my Prettier setup](/blog/2018-09-13-my-prettier-cheatsheet/) and another about [how to customise styled-components](/blog/2018-09-14-customising-styled-components-with-props/). I've started tracking which blog posts I want to write on a Trello board and this is helping me be more productive."
- 📚 Sara Souieden has inspired me twice, once to [convert my hex to hsl colour values](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/hex-rgb-to-hsl) and again to [just write](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write).
- "📚 I've written unit tests for Sass in the past and it's great [to see other people doing it too](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/how_and_why_we_unit_test_our_sass)."
- "📚 This blog post about [why it's important to have browser diversity](https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/) is a must-read for any web developer."
- 📚 I wish I knew [this trick to inspect elements that hide when inactive](https://elijahmanor.com/inspect-tricky-elements/) a couple of years ago!
