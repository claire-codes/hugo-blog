- "🎃 Blogtober is going … OK? As of 8th October I had 4 published blog posts. Even though I’m not posting every day as I intended, I’m really happy with the content I’ve published so far. [You can find a list of all my posts here](/blog/2018-10-01-blogtober-2018/)."
- ✨ [This careers poster from Finding Ada](https://findingada.com/blog/2018/10/08/new-careers-poster-what-kind-of-technologist-could-i-be/) is amazing! It explains all the different technology careers other than just as a programmer.
- 🐛 There’s a bug in Chrome (and others) where emoji don’t display correctly over a certain font-size. [At least I’m not the only one who’s noticed this](https://tobireif.com/posts/maximum_font_size_for_emoji/)!
- 📚 [This was a really well written blog post about modular CSS](https://spaceninja.com/2018/09/17/what-is-modular-css/)
