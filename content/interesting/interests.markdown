- 'ðŸ“š I read [this blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26) that proposed that you didnâ€™t always need to use arrow functions: this was an interesting viewpoint as I sometimes think that I should replace every instance of `function() { return x }` with a fat arrow, which this post suggests isnâ€™t always necessary.'
- âœ¨ I created a [new GitHub repo](https://github.com/claireparker/insta-art) to hold all the CSS illustrations I make for photos on my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/claire_codes/), like in [this photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj8C28rBhWQ/?taken-by=claire_codes).
- ðŸ–¥ I started working on a web scraper for some price information (private repo sorry!). I started off with Cheerio and Node, but switched to [NightmareJs](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) when I realised that the info I wanted was generated clientside, and that promises could help me. I used [this thorough blog post](https://hackernoon.com/nightmarishly-good-scraping-with-nightmare-js-and-async-await-b7b20a38438f) for assistance.
- ðŸ—“ I went to this monthâ€™s [McrFRED meet up](https://www.meetup.com/McrFRED/) where we heard about serverless architecture for frontend apps. This isnâ€™t something I think about on a day-to-day basis so it was a neat introduction to the topic and a good recommendation for AWS if I happen to need something like this for a personal project.
