title: Interesting
---

This page is an experimental diary-blog-thingy where I post a few things that I've either worked on, accomplished, or have read over the past few days. I try to post once a week. An item might be a blog post, a Codepen, a StackOverflow question, or something else. I'm not really sure, I'm still playing about with the concept. Name suggestions are welcome too because I don't like "Interesting" but naming things good is hard ðŸ¤¯
