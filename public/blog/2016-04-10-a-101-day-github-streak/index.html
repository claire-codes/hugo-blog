<p>üìÜ I was going to call this post &ldquo;101 days of coding&rdquo;, but that would be misleading. I&rsquo;ve been getting paid to write code as a web developer for over 2 years now, but over the past 3+ months I&rsquo;ve been writing code in my spare time - after work, after chores, after slobbing in front of the TV - and then committing and pushing it to GitHub. The really weird and pointless thing about this is that I&rsquo;ve done it every day since the 1st of January this year and now I have a pretty good streak, just look at my <a href="https://github.com/claireparker">GitHub scorecard</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/101-streak.png" alt="A 101 day streak on GitHub" title="A 101 day streak on GitHub" /></p>

<p>üëèüëèüëè</p>

<h2 id="why">‚ùì Why??</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Because I am a sucker for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamificiation</a></em> - I üíõ seeing those little squares go green and watching that streak getting bigger and bigger each day. (you may have come across this before as a trick to build a habit called <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">Don&rsquo;t Break the Chain</a>)</li>
<li><em>Because I genuinely enjoy coding</em> - this isn&rsquo;t a chore or obligation for me and I still enjoy developing even after doing it all day at work.</li>
<li><em>Because this is my time to learn new things</em> - there&rsquo;s always something new to learn in web development (I&rsquo;m a frontend developer) and it&rsquo;s important to keep on top of things. I don&rsquo;t get time to try out the latest thing at work because &hellip; I&rsquo;m at work, doing my job. It&rsquo;s a given that you have to swot up in your own time in web dev. Putting all my experiments on GitHub means they&rsquo;re available for future reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>The gamification of the GitHub scorecard feature has helped me build a regular habit to study and code a little each day, and to get side-projects and practice apps to a reasonable, useful state instead of discarding them after 30 minutes when the new technology becomes mildly challenging.</p>

<h2 id="how">‚ÄºÔ∏è How?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m on my computer every day anyway, so it&rsquo;s not a big stretch to close Twitter and open Atom instead and write some code.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t write 1000 lines a day: some days I&rsquo;ll make 10 commits and on others I&rsquo;ll only have time for 1. Most nights I&rsquo;ll spend between half an hour to an hour coding. When I&rsquo;m short on time it might be something that doesn&rsquo;t involve too much thinking, a task I&rsquo;ve done before like adding code coverage to a project, or tinkering with styling. And remember time spent coding is not proportional to the lines of code written (especially if you&rsquo;re debugging! üêõ), nor are all commits created equal. The rule is it must be substantial and tangible enough to be worth a commit!</p>

<h2 id="but-why-who-cares">‚ÅâÔ∏è But, why? Who cares?</h2>

<p>No one cares but me! I&rsquo;m fully aware that having a streak on GitHub doesn&rsquo;t make you a good coder, or make you perform better at your job, or imply anything at all about your skillset, but I&rsquo;m finding it a huge motivator for me to stop procrastinating and frittering my time away on social media and instead to get better at something I üíú. It&rsquo;s nice not to feel my brain dribbling out my earhole while watching Netflix or scrolling through a newsfeed.</p>

<p>The small bit of work that I put in every day (e.g. adding localstorage to a Backbone app, or adding multiple choice prompts to my Yeoman generator, or converting some ES5 to ES6) adds up learning a lot over time and has made me feel already, in just over 3 months, a much stronger and more confident software developer in terms of writing code and building apps from scratch, rather than just &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; about that technology and never having got my hands dirty. None of the apps or projects that I&rsquo;m working on are going to change the world or make me a millionaire: they&rsquo;re just hobby projects that I use to hone my skills.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I have a healthy balance between real-person relationships and IRL activities and my computer. My other half is aware of my current streak, but it&rsquo;s not that hard or disruptive to take 30 minutes out of a day and sit on the computer and it doesn&rsquo;t stop me from fulfilling any other commitments. How much time do you waste on Twitter and Facebook already?</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t got an end date - just look at <a href="https://github.com/jeresig">John Resig&rsquo;s over 2 year streak</a>! - I&rsquo;m just taking it one day at a time. üåû</p>

<ul>
<li>this blog</li>
<li>a Yeoman generator to build Jekyll posts for my blog</li>
<li>published 5 npm modules, including CLIs in Node and ES6</li>
<li>fully tested said-modules and set up continuous integration and code coverage (but all my code backed up by unit tests as standard, and yours should be too! üòÅ)</li>
<li>Backbone apps (my Backbone knowledge was <code>null</code> on 1st January)</li>
<li>a package for the Atom text editor using CoffeeScript</li>
<li>web scraping with Ruby</li>
